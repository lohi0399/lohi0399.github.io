👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Researcher at the TU Delft.

🔬 My research interests lie in neuromorphic computing, edge AI, and biologically inspired algorithms for energy-efficient and sustainable intelligent systems.

# Masters Thesis
📚 My Master's Thesis was on the topic - "Neuromorphic Compression and Distributed Computing for On-Implant Neural Signal Processing in Brain-Computer Interfaces", Aug 2024. The link to this thesis can be found in [TU Delft Repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:edb117cf-eac0-4a9e-9e4b-dd90963be03f).

🏆 Awarded Second Prize in the “Best MSc Graduate Awards” at Delft Bioengineering Institute, Dec 2024.
