👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Researcher at the TU Delft.

🔬 My research interests lie in neuromorphic computing, edge AI, and biologically inspired algorithms for energy-efficient and sustainable intelligent systems.

# Masters Thesis
📚 My Master's Thesis was on the topic - "Neuromorphic Compression and Distributed Computing for On-Implant Neural Signal Processing in Brain-Computer Interfaces", Aug 2024.

🏆 Awarded Second Prize in the “Best MSc Graduate Awards” at Delft Bioengineering Institute, Dec 2024.

# Selected Projects
👩🏻‍💻 Power-Efficient Two-Step Data Compression and Distributed Computing System for Extreme-
Edge Devices using Spiking Neural Networks under the European Research Council (ERC), 2024
(Thesis Grade: 9, Best MSc Graduate Award)

👩🏻‍💻 Cross-Language Communication Enhancement using Transformer Models for Real-Time
Translation on Cloud Platforms, 2024.

👩🏻‍💻 Voice & Vision assistant using OpenAI Real-Time API and Llama open-source vision models,
with AI agents and dynamic function calling using WebRTC-based LiveKit framework, 2024.

👩🏻‍💻Utilizing Spatial Data Science Techniques to Uncover Healthcare Vulnerabilities in the City of
Rotterdam, 2024.

👩🏻‍💻Finger velocity Decoding with In vivo neural data using Efficient Spiking Neural Networks, 2023.

👩🏻‍💻Implemented Mobile Applications using Java, Featuring Algorithms for KNN, Bayes, and Particle
Filter for Human Activity Detection, 2023.

👩🏻‍💻Developed a drone-based system for deforested land detection using YOLO v3 and automated
seed dispersal with APM 2.8 and Raspberry Pi, 2021.
<!-- # Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
